## üëã Hey, I'm Yuriy Klishch

I'm a web developer passionate about building innovative and efficient solutions. Programming has always been my passion. I first started learning it during my years in IT Step Academy, where I gained a solid foundation in Python, C, and C++. After completing my studies, I decided to specialize in web development. Following a few specialized courses, I have honed my skills and am now seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in a professional setting. Currently, I'm majoring in Software Engineering and Business Analysis at [KSE](https://university.kse.ua/en). Beyond my technical pursuits, I maintain active engagement in various activities within my university community.
